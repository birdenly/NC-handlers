# <img src="nucleus.png" alt="drawing" width="25" height="25"/>  Nucleus Co-op handlers
All the handlers i have made for [Nucleus Co-op](https://nucleus-coop.github.io/) for fun. Support me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/birden_) if you liked anything i made.

**Broken handlers** either are broken because of server auth, broken input or the LAN of the game has problems that i couldnt fix.

**Working handlers** are all the ones that got, or will, be [released officialy](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/rRycxSn253ZCjQy5C) in Nucleus Co-op or that wont be relased for reasons, but do work.

**Youtube playlist showcasing/tutorial of most of the released handlers**
